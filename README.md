# Clone Page Tree

WordPress plugin that adds a "Clone Page Tree" action to the page row actions.  Cloning a page tree clones the page and all descendents creating a new copy of the full hierarchy.  After clicking "Clone Page Tree" you will be redirected to edit the top-most page to allow you to give it a unique title.  All cloned pages are left in draft mode.

There are [many plugins out there](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/duplicate/) which allow you to duplicate a post or page however this is the only one that allows you to duplicate a page and all its descendent pages in a single click.

This plugin used the page duplication script [here](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-clone-wordpress-page-post) as a starting point but then adds recursion over page children to clone the full tree.
